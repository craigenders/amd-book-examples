! EXAMPLE 3.6 - FIML Regression (Sequential Predictors)

DATA:
file = smoking.dat;
VARIABLE:
names = id intensity hvysmoker age parsmoke female race income educ;
missing = all(999);
usevariables = intensity parsmoke income age;
categorical = parsmoke;
DEFINE:
center income age (grandmean);
ANALYSIS:
link = logit;
estimator = mlr;
integration = montecarlo;
MODEL:
! factored (sequential) specification for predictors;
age;
parsmoke on age;
income on parsmoke age;
! label slope coefficients in focal model;
intensity on parsmoke (b1)
	income (b2)
	age (b3);
MODEL TEST:
! wald test that all slopes equal 0;
b1 = 0; 
b2 = 0; 
b3 = 0; 
OUTPUT:
patterns sampstat cinterval;
