! EXAMPLE 2.10 - FIML Regression w Robust SEs and Wald Test

DATA:
file = smokingcomplete.dat;
VARIABLE:
names = id intensity hvysmoker age parsmoke female race income educ;
usevariables = intensity parsmoke age income;
DEFINE:
center age income (grandmean);
ANALYSIS:
! robust standard errors and test statistics;
estimator = mlr;
MODEL:
! label slope coefficients in focal model;
intensity on parsmoke (b1)
	age (b2)
	income (b3);
MODEL TEST:
! wald test that all slopes equal 0;
0 = b1;
0 = b2;
0 = b3;
OUTPUT:
sampstat stdyx cinterval;
